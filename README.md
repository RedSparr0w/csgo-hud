# CS:GO HUD

## Before Running
- Windows task bar must be set to 'Auto-hide' otherwise the HUD may get cut off
- Copy 'gamestate_integration_csgohud.cfg' from cfg folder to your csgo cfg folder 'steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg/'
- cfg must be moved prior to launching CS:GO!
- CS:GO must be running in Fullscreen Windowed!
